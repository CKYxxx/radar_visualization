3D Graphics
3D visualizations use the following mouse interaction:

Left button drag: Rotates the scene around a central point

Middle button drag: Pan the scene by moving the central “look-at” point within the x-y plane

Middle button drag + CTRL: Pan the scene by moving the central “look-at” point along the z axis

Wheel spin: zoom in/out

Wheel + CTRL: change field-of-view angle

And keyboard controls:

Arrow keys rotate around central point, just like dragging the left mouse button
